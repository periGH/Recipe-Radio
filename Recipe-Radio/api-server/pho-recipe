For the broth
Water
2 large oxtail chunks
1.5kg beef shin, flank or beef rib
1kg beef bones
2 litres chicken stock
1 large onion, peeled and topped and tailed 
200g ginger, peeled and halved
1 hand-size piece of daikon, peeled, halved
30 star anise
6 cloves
2 cinnamon sticks
1 heaped tsp coriander seeds 
1 heaped tsp fennel seeds 
2 black cardamom pods
30g rock sugar (or 2 tsp caster sugar)
3 tsp salt
6 tbsp fish sauce
75g dry flat rice noodles per person

To garnish
Black pepper
Birdâ€™s eye chillies, finely sliced 
Red onion, thinly sliced
Spring onions, sliced
A handful of coriander, coarsely chopped
Lime wedges

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the meat and bones. Boil for 10 minutes to clean the meat, until froth surfaces. Take them off the heat, discard all the water and rinse the meat.

Wash the pot, fill with four litres of water, bring to a boil, add the meat and stock, cover and simmer. Meanwhile, char the onion, ginger and daikon on a griddle, then add to the broth.

Add the spices, sugar and salt to the broth, and simmer, covered, for two hours, skimming off impurities.

Remove the meat and, once cooled, slice thinly. Leave the bones and oxtail in the broth to simmer for one hour then season with fish sauce to taste.

To serve, cook the noodles according to packet instructions, drain, then portion into bowls and season with black pepper and chilli slices. Top with sliced meat, red onion, spring onion and coriander, then ladle over the broth, submerging everything. Serve with lime wedges.
